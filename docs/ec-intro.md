# Historial introduction to Evolutionary Computation

Early work on Evolutionary Computation (EC) was based on the application of evolutionary
systems such as optimisation methods, feedback-control approaches, or automatic tools to
generate computer programs. In this dissertation, evolutionary system refers to Darwinian
evolutionary systems, and consists of the following features:

* There exists a population of individuals which compete for limited resources.
* Due to the birth and death of individuals, the population changes dynamically.
* The ability of an individual to reproduce and survive is called fitness.
* The fact that offspring are similar, but not identical, to their parents is known
as variational inheritance.
